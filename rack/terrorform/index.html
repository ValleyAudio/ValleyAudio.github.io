    <p>
      Terrorform is a shapeshifting, voltage controlled, wavetable synthesis voice that focuses on the efficient exploration
      and discovery of new timbres. It is a derivative of the core oscillator code from the Dexter module, but with many
      enhancements that allow it to be its own, independent module. Terrorform is not solely an oscillator, as with the addition
      of the lowpass gate (LPG) it can become a basic synth voice or percussive source.
    </p>
    <h3>A bit of trivia</h3>
    <p>
      The name Terrorform is a reference to two things.
      <br>
      <br>
      First, it is a play on the word terraforming, which is a hypothetical process of modifying the landscape, oceans, and atmosphere of a planet
      in order to make it habitable for life. This is essentially what you are doing in Terrorform: sculpting and shaping the sound from a base
      wave to create something new.
      <br>
      <br>
      Second, it is a reference to the British sci-fi sitcom "Red Dwarf", and is named after the episode "Terrorform". In the episode,
      the "beloved" hologram Rimmer is taken prisoner by manifestations of his own mind on a shapeshifting psy-moon.
      <br>
      <br>
      To quote the episode:

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>
      In normal operation, the tuning of Terrorform is set using the blue pitch controls at the very top, and is offset using
      the sum of the two VOct inputs. The read phasor shaping is set using the <b>Shape Type</b> and <b>Shape Depth</b> knobs, and the
      output waveform is further enhanced by the <b>Enhancer</b>. The mode and depth of the <b>Enhancer</b> is set by the <b>Enhancer
      Type</b> and <b>Enhancer Depth</b> knobs.
    </p>

    <h3 id="usage-waves">Waves</h3>
    <p>
      As name of the module implies, the sound is <b>terraformed</b> using wavetable synthesis. Wavetable synthesis is a tone
      generation method that is used to generate more complex waveforms than the typical Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth and Pulse
      waveforms found on most synthesizers. In this method, a tone is generated by reading back the contents of a
      pre-generated table of complex waveforms using a rising ramp wave, or <b>phasor</b>. This is the beating heart of the module.
      To create evolving tones and add movement to the sound, the table is continuously scanned or, essentially, cross-faded
      between adjacent waves in the table.

      In Terrorform, there are 64 built-in wavetable banks, each with their own timbral characteristics. These are set by the
      <b>Bank</b> and <b>Wave</b> knobs, where <b>Bank</b> selects which wavetable bank to accessed, and <b>Wave</b> scans through the wavetable
      itself.
    </p>

    <h3 id="usage-phasor">Phasor Shaper</h3>
    <p>
      To add more <i>flavour</i> and variation to the waveform, the wavetable read phasor can be shaped in many different ways. The
      shaping type is set by <b>Shape Type</b>, and the depth is set by <b>Shape Depth</b>. The following table lists and describes each
      mode of the phasor shaper:

      Once the wavetable has been read, the generated a waveform can be even further enhanced. The enhancer is essentially a
      waveshaper. This is different from phasor shaping which affects how the wavetable is read, but instead this <i>shapes</i> the
      resulting output waveform after the table has been read. The following table lists and describes each mode of the

      When the LPG is enabled, in its default state the signal chain is <b>Wavetable Reader > Enhancer > Lowpass Gate.</b>
      However, by enabling the "Swap EH & LPG" button, the order can be switched to <b>Wavetable Reader > Lowpass Gate >
      Enhancer.</b>
    </p>

    <h3 id="usage-lpg">Lowpass Gate</h3>

      The LPG is enabled / disabled by holding down the "LPG" button for more than 0.5 seconds. There are three modes for the
      LPG: VCA, Filter, and Filter + VCA. These are cycled through by clicking the LPG button. Each mode is indicated by a
      colour:
    </p>
    <center>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Button Colour</th>

      </table>
    </center>
    <p>
      The LPG is controlled by an envelope that can be gated by gate signals received at the "Gate" inputs. Like your
      traditional A/D envelope, the envelope goes into the attack phase when the gate is high (> 0v), and then decay phase
      when low (<= 0v). If whilst the envelope is in its attack phase and the gate goes low, the envelope immediately enters
      the decay phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your gates are short, e.g. are 1ms long trigger signals, and you have a slow attack, then the envelope amplitude will
      be too weak for the signal to be audible. The solution for this is to toggle the "Trig" button, which puts the envelope
      into a re-triggerable, one-shot mode. In this mode, the envelope will complete one cycle when it receives a trigger
      signal at the "Gate" inputs, regardless of the length of the signal. However, because this mode is re-triggerable, the
      envelope will immediately restart its attack phase when receiving subsequent trigger signals, regardless of what phase
      or the progress of the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack and decay of the envelope is set by the respective "Attack" and "Decay" knobs that flank the LPG button.
      Toggling the "Long" button extends the attack / decay time range. Velocity sensitivity is enabled by toggling the
      "Velo." button. The sum of the voltages at the gate inputs determines the overall amplitude of the envelope, thus either
      affecting the loudness or the brightness of the LPG. This is useful for adding dynamics when creating percussive sounds
      with Terrorform.
    </p>

    <h3 id="usage-sync">Syncronisation</h3>
    <p>
      Synchronisation, or sync for short, is a method of forcing an oscillator to reset so that match its pitch to another
      oscillator. This is usually achieved by sending a pulse or other zero-crossing signal from source oscillator into the a
      special sync input on the target oscillator. When a new pulse is detected, known as a <i>sync event</i>, the target
      oscillator resets. This usually results in buzzy overtones depending on the type of synchronisation (the reset method
      described is known as hard sync). Terrorform features 16 synchronisation types.
    </p>

      The following table describes what happens to the read phasor upon detection of a sync event:

    <h3 id="usage-zerofreq">Zero Frequency</h3>
    <p>
      <i>"Zero Frequency? What is the purpose of that?!"</i> I hear you say
    </p>
    <p>
    The eagle eyed amongst you may have noticed one of the benefits of including the <i>DX style phase mod</i> flavour of FM.
      Remember, in phase modulation, the phase of the of the read phasor is shifted, regardless of frequency. Therefore, if
      the frequency is zero and you shift the phase of the read phasor, you will still read the contents of the wavetable but
      with an external source. When this feature is enabled, the read phasor is "parked" at the beginning of the wavetable so
      that no hidden phase offset is introduced.

      The following two sub-sections discuss example uses for this feature.
    </p>
    <h4>Example 1: Leader-Follower</h4>
    <p>
      Zero frequency allows you to drive a "follower" Terrorform module in "phase mod" mode with a "leader" Terrorform. First,
      put the "follower" Terrorform into "Zero Frequency" mode by pressing the "Zero" button, and ensure that the "True FM"
      button is off (i.e <i>DX Style Phase Mod</i> mode). Then, connect the "Phasor Output" from the leader Terrorform (not in Zero
      Frequency mode) into an FM input of the "follower" and turn up the FM input's attenuator (see following screenshot). You
      will begin to hear a sound as before, but the pitch is now controlled by the "leader" module. In the "follower", you
      will still have the shaping and wave enhancement features, but also have perfect pitch and phase matched signals between
      both modules. You can drive as many Terrorform modules as you want using one or more leaders and their phasor outputs
      connected to the followers FM inputs.
    </p>

    </center>

    <h4>Example 2: Complex Waveshaper</h4>
    <p>
      Zero frequency is not limited to letting you drive Terrorforms with other Terrorform. As long as any signal, either AC
      or DC, is connected to the FM input whilst in <i>DX Style Phase Mod</i> mode, the wavetable reading then controlled by this
      external signal. This turns Terrorform into a complex waveshaper, where the result is controlled by the wave, shaper,
      and enhancement parameters.
    </p>

    </center>

    <h2 id="manager">User Wavetable Manager</h2>
    <p>
      Got bored of the built-in tables? Want to load in your own? Terrorform lets you load up to 64 wavetable banks as .WAV
      files, where each bank can contain up to 64 waves that are 256 samples per cycle in length. This particular
      specification was chosen so that wavetables generated in the free "WaveEdit" tool from Synthesis Technology (no
      affiliation) could be used directly in Terrorform with no compatibility issues. However, wavetables that use longer cycle
      lengths, e.g. those generated using the Serum software synthesizer, can also be loaded, although these are then resampled
      on load in order to fit into memory allocated for Terrorform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only can you load in wavetables banks, but the banks are saved into your patch file. This means that you do not have
      to load in your banks each time you re-load your patch, and it allows your patch to be portable and easily shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can export and load your banks as single ROM files. These are known as Valley Wave Table files and have the
      file extension ".vwt". These files will allow you to swap out entire groups of banks without the need to laboriously
      load individual .wav files when you want to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the ability to load your own wavetables expands the timbral palette of Terrorform, and allows the you to tailor
      the sound to your own needs.
    </p>

    <h3 id="manager-accesing">Accessing and using the manager</h3>
    <p>
      The manager is accessed by right-clicking on Terrorform to access the context menu, and then selected "Open" under
      "Wavetable manager". The knobs will disappear to reveal the User Wavetable Manager menu system where you will be
      presented with six options (see previous). Here you can access the bank editor, 'defrag'ment the bank memory, export and
      load ROM files, or delete the entire user bank memory entirely and start again from scratch.
    </p>

      <img src="images/managerMainMenu.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; max-height:600px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    </center>

    <h3 id="manager-loading">Loading, viewing, and deleting</h3>
    <p>
      Wavetable banks are loaded into the module as a single channel .WAV file. The waveforms should be arranged in the .WAV
      file to appear continuously, one after another in 256 sample long blocks. In other words, one cycle of a wave in your
      bank should be 256 samples long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to 64 waves can be your .WAV file, bringing the total length of the file to 16,384 samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      To load a file into a bank slot, starting from the Manager main menu, go to Edit, pick an empty slot from the grid, and
      click the "Load" button. A file explorer should open where you can then navigate to where your .WAV file is on your
      computer. Once opened, you will be asked to name your bank, and be shown a visualisation of it.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="images/loaderWaveView.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; max-height:600px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    </center>
    <p>
      The name can be up to 9 characters long. You can crop the bank by selecting the start and end waves from the draggable
      number boxes at the top. Finally, you can scrub through the wavetable using clicking and dragging the visualiser with
      your mouse, and inspect the individual waves with the display at the bottom.
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="images/loaderDone.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; max-height:600px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    </center>
    <p>
      To complete loading, click <b>Okay</b>, and you will be taken back to the slot grid where you can now see your
      chosen slot now glowing red. You can continue adding more waves by choosing another slot and clicking on <b>Load</b>
      to begin the process again.
    </p>
    <h3 id="manager-cloning">Cloning and moving</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst cloning a bank may seem pointless at first, where you may ask yourself "Why do I want two copies of the same
      bank?", but this feature allows you to crop the bank whilst cloning, allowing you to focus in on a certain section of
      the table without needing to load the original .WAV file.
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="images/cloneWaveView.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; max-height:600px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    </center>
    <p>
      To clone a bank, select it and click the "Clone" button. You will be shown a similar visualisation window as when
      loading a bank from a file. Here, you can view the table and select the range of waves to clone by setting the draggable,
      start and end wave number boxes at the top.
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="images/cloneDestination.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; max-height:600px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
    </center>
    <p>
      Moving a bank is almost the same, except the bank is moved rather than cloned to its new destination. To do this, click
      the "Move" button. Unlike cloning you cannot crop the waveform, so you will only be shown the destination screen. Once
      selected, click "Okay", and you will be taken back to the slot grid. Clicking on 'Next' will take you to the destination
      screen. Here you select which destination bank you want source bank to be cloned to. Once selected, click on "Okay", and
      then the source will be cloned to the new destination bank.
    </p>
    <h3 id="manager-viewing">Viewing</h3>
    <p>
      Just want to admire your wavetables? Click on the view button! You can look at each wave in the box at the bottom by
      dragging vertically in the 3D wave view.
    </p>
    <h3 id="manage-defrag">Defragmentation</h3>
    <p>
      If you find that after removing, cloning, or moving around your banks has left your grid looking like Swiss cheese. Much
      like old hard disk drives, many data operations can leave all the stored data scattered and fragmented about the disk.
      Unlike hard disk drives, this does not affect the performance of Terrorform, but it may not be very aesthetically
      pleasing to you, and you may want to tidy up your banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, like for hard disk drives, there is a defragmentation feature built into the manager that will remove the gaps
      between banks and bring them all next to each other. To "defragment" your banks, from the main menu when you first open
      the manager, click on "Defrag" and the process will instantaneously defragment your banks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="appendix-a">Appendix A: How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Terrorform generates a tone using "wavetable lookup synthesis". This is the exact same method used in each operator in
      Dexter. As the name suggests, the tone is generated by looking up and reading back the contents of a wavetable. The
      lookup process is done by a rising ramp wave, known as a read phasor, that reads the table from beginning to end at a
      set frequency. Different waves in a bank can be scanned through by cross fading between adjacent tables within the same
      bank. The read phasor can be shaped in several ways that can alter the output waveform. Terrorform offers 27 shaping
      modes. After being read, the resulting signal is passed through the <i>Enhancer</i>. This further shapes the signal in
      different ways such as bit-crushing, Chebyshev waveshaping, folding, and more.

      respective parameters are the same regardless of whether "Swap" is enbable.</i>
