    <p>Terrorform is a shapeshifting, voltage controlled, wavetable synthesis voice that focuses on the efficient exploration and discovery of new timbres. It is a derivative of the core oscillator code from the Dexter module, but with many enhancements that allow it to be its own, independent module. Terrorform is not solely an oscillator, as with the addition of the lowpass gate (LPG) it can become a basic synth voice or percussive source.</p>
