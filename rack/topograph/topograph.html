    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Topograph & µGraph are drum sequencer modules that emulate the Mutable Instruments' "Grids". Rather than relying on the user to manually enter patterns, the modules each have a vast, built-in map of drum patterns that can be seamlessy explored using high level controls, making this a 'topographic' sequencer (hence the name). The sequences include various styles of patterns from different cultures around the world, including Euclidean rhythms. Before continuing, as these modules have the same features as Grids, it is worth reading its manual over <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/">here</a>
