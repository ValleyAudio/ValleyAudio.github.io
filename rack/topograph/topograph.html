    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Topograph & µGraph are drum sequencer modules that emulate the Mutable Instruments' "Grids", using the exact same code implemented here for Rack. Before continuing, as these modules have the same features as Grids, it is worth reading its manual over <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/">here</a>
