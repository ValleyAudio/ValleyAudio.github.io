    <p>
        Topograph & µGraph are 3 channel drum sequencer modules that emulate the Mutable Instruments' "Grids". Rather than relying on the user to manually enter patterns, the modules each have a vast, built-in map of drum patterns that can be seamlessy explored using high level controls, making this a 'topographic' sequencer (hence the name). The sequences include various styles of pattern 'skeletons' from around the world, and the density of each part can be set from sparse and simple through to dense and frantic. Before continuing, as these modules have the same features as Grids, it is worth reading its manual over <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/">here</a>

            <li style="font-size: 1.25em;">"How do I make Topograph / µGraph syncronise to a clock source?"</li>
            <li style="list-style:none; font-size:0.8em">Make sure that a clock signal is plugged into the Clock jack, turn the blue tempo knob fully left until the BPM text reads "Ext", and then press Run</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.25em;">"The sequencer is too slow when I use an external clock source!"</li>
            <li style="list-style:none; font-size:0.8em">You need to make sure that the clock resolution / multiplier / PPQN matches the sequencer's resolution set in the conext menu under (Topograph) or "Clock Res" box (µGraph)</li>
