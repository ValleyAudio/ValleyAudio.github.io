    <p>
        Topograph & µGraph are 3 channel drum sequencer modules that emulate the Mutable Instruments' "Grids". Rather than relying on the user to manually enter patterns, the modules each have a vast, built-in map of drum patterns that can be seamlessy explored using high level controls, making this a 'topographic' sequencer (hence the name). The sequences include various styles of pattern 'skeletons' from around the world, and the density of each part can be set from sparse and simple through to dense and frantic. Before continuing, as these modules have the same features as Grids, it is worth reading its manual over <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/manual/">here</a>

    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tempo:</b> The blue knob controls the tempo or speed of the sequencer. Fully left enables external clocking.</li>
        <li><b>Map X/Y:</b> Sets the pattern skeleton. These controls are continuously variable, which means the patterns can be smoothly morphed between.</li>
        <li><b>Chaos:</b> Determines how often the density of each pattern channel will vary after each bar.</li>
        <li><b>Density:</b> These three knobs control how dense each channel will be. Fully left effectively mutes the channel, whilst fully right causes the channel's pattern to be very dense and regular</li>
        <li><b>Swing:</b> Controls the swing or groove of the sequence. This is not normally available in Grids whete normally the Chaos knob is sacrificed. This also allows fow swing in Euclidean mode.</li>
    </ul>

            <b>Panel Style:</b> Changes the colour of the front panel. Useful for when patching in poor lighting conditions.

        <li style="font-size: 1.25em;">"How do I make Topograph / µGraph synchronise to a clock source?"</li>
        <li style="list-style:none; font-size:0.9em">Make sure that a clock signal is plugged into the Clock jack, turn the blue tempo knob fully left until the BPM text reads "Ext", and then press Run</li>
        <li style="font-size: 1.25em;">"The sequencer is too slow when I use an external clock source!"</li>
        <li style="list-style:none; font-size:0.9em">You need to make sure that the clock resolution / multiplier / PPQN matches the sequencer's resolution set in the conext menu under (Topograph) or "Clock Res" box (µGraph)</li>
    </ul>
