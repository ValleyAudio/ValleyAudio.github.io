    <h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
    <p>FM synthesis is a technique that is often shied away from due to its apparent complex nature and unfamiliar parameters. This perception is usually caused by the bad interface design in the synthesiser that popularised the technique in the 1980s, the Yamaha DX7</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dexter approaches FM synthesis from a usability perspective, as in all the parameters are brought out and made accessible to the user. It employs the traditional 4 operator, algorithmic approach with some neat twists, such as wavetables, phase distortion and sync in  order to broaden the sonic pallet of FM synthesis. Sometimes it can be mellow, pristine and chilled, however with a simple knob twist it can becoming growling, snarling and noisy. Almost all of the parameters can be modulated by control voltages, allowing for easy exploration of FM, leading to new sounds and possibilities.</p>

    <p>The master controls are the main go-to controls in Dexter for basic parameters such as tuning, chords, algorithm selection and overall shape and brightness.</p>
