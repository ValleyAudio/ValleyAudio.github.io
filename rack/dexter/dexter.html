    <h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
    <p>FM synthesis is a technique that is often shied away from due to its apparent complex nature and unfamiliar parameters. This perception is usually caused by the bad interface design in the synthesiser that popularised the technique in the 1980s, the Yamaha DX7</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Dexter approaches FM synthesis from a usability perspective, as in all the parameters are brought out and made accessible to the user. It employs the traditional 4 operator, algorithmic approach with some neat twists, such as wavetables, phase distortion and sync in  order to broaden the sonic pallet of FM synthesis. Sometimes it can be mellow, pristine and chilled, however with a simple knob twist it can becoming growling, snarling and noisy. Almost all of the parameters can be modulated by control voltages, allowing for easy exploration of FM, leading to new sounds and possibilities.

    <h3 id="masterControls">Master Controls</h3>
    <p>
        The master controls are the main go-to controls in Dexter for basic parameters such as tuning, chords, algorithm selection and overall shape and brightness.
    </p>
    <h3 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        An algorithm describes how each operator modulates and synchronises another, and to which output they are directed to, via a routing matrix. It can be thought of as a recipe for a particular type of sound, as algorithms are often optimised for particular timbres e.g. metallic, brassy, smooth, vocal etc. Dexter offers 23 algorithms where 12 of these share operators for both voices A and B, and the remaining 11 dedicate operators to either A or B allowing for independent timbres from each voice. By default, the algorithms also determine the synchronisation source for each operator, where operators synchronise to their parent operator. This can be changed in the context menu to “neighbour” where an operator syncs to the operator to its right on the panel i.e. 1 &rarr; 2 , 2 &rarr; 3 and 3 &rarr; 4.
    </p>
    <h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
    <p>
        Dexter features 4 operators shared between two “Voices”, A and B. Voice A is able to output chords of up to 7 notes spread across stereo outputs (A L and A R), whilst Voice B outputs a mono signal from “B Out”. Both voices can be independently tuned allowing for multi-timbral patches. The individual operators outputs, OP 1 to 4, tap a signal directly from an operator of either Voice A or B regardless of the chosen algorithm.

    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>
        The operators generate a tone using lookup wavetable synthesis using a rising ramp, known as a read phasor, to read the contents of a table. Waves can be scanned through by cross fading between adjacent tables within the same bank of tables. FM synthesis is achieved by offsetting the read phasor’s value with another signal, effectively speeding up / slowing down the read speed. Whilst this is technically known as phase-modulation (PM) and is not true FM, this still modulates the frequency and gives the same effect. If anything, PM is easier to implement, and it is a standard method in commercial FM synthesizers such as the DX series. To expand the versatility of FM synthesis, the read phasor can be shaped in several ways that can distort and mangle the output waveform. Dexter offers 12 shaping modes. By default, the modulator signal  is added to the read phasor before shaping, however it can be added post shaping by engaging the “Post Shpe” button. This allows for an alternative timbre and at times can make the shaping sound more pleasant.
